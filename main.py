# Print the result
print(f"The area of the circle with radius {radius} is {area:.2f}")
#3. Write a program that asks the user for the length and width of a rectangle. The program then prints out the perimeter and area of the rectangle. The perimeter of a rectangle is the sum of the lengths of each four sides.
# Ask the user for the length and width of the rectangle
length = float(input("Enter the length of the rectangle: "))
width = float(input("Enter the width of the rectangle: "))

# Calculate the perimeter and area of the rectangle

print(f"Average: {average:.2f}")
#5. Write a program that asks the user to enter a mass in medieval units: talents (leiviskÃ¤), pounds (naula), and lots (luoti). The program converts the input to full kilograms and grams and outputs the result to the user:
#One talent is 20 pounds.
#One pound is 32 lots.
#One lot is 13,3 grams.
# Conversion factors
talent_to_kg = 30.24  # 1 talent is approximately 30.24 kg

# Ask the user for the mass in medieval units
talents = float(input("Enter the number of talents: "))
pounds = float(input("Enter the number of pounds: "))
lots = float(input("Enter the number of lots: "))

# Convert to kilograms and grams
mass_kg = (talents * talent_to_kg) + (pounds * pound_to_kg)
mass_g = lots * lot_to_g

# Split mass_kg into whole kilograms and grams
whole_kg = int(mass_kg)
remaining_g = int((mass_kg - whole_kg) * 1000)

# Print the result
print(f"The mass is {whole_kg} kilograms and {remaining_g} grams.")

# Module - 3
#Write a program that asks a fisher the length of a zander in centimeters. If the zander does not fulfill the size limit, the program instructs to release the fish back into the lake and notifies the user of how many centimeters below the size limit the caught fish was. A zander must be 42 centimeters or longer to meet the size limit.
# Define the size limit for the zander
size_limit = 42  # Minimum size in centimeters

    print("Hemoglobin value is low.")
else:
    print("Hemoglobin value is high.")
#4.Write a program that asks the user to enter a year and notifies the user whether the input year is a leap year. A year is a leap year if it is divisible by four. However, years divisible by 100 are leap years only if they are also divisible by 400.
# Ask the user to enter a year
year = int(input("Enter a year: "))

# Check if it's a leap year
if (year % 4 == 0 and year % 100 != 0) or (year % 400 == 0):
    print(f"{year} is a leap year.")

    # Convert inches to centimeters and print the result
    centimeters = inches * inches_to_cm
    print(f"{inches} inches is equal to {centimeters:.2f} centimeters")
#3. Write a program that asks the user to enter numbers until they enter an empty string to quit. Finally, the program prints out the smallest and largest number from the numbers it received.
# Initialize variables for the smallest and largest numbers

    print(f"Largest number: {largest}")
else:
    print("No valid numbers entered.")
#4. Write a game where the computer draws a random integer between 1 and 10. The user tries to guess the number until they guess the right number. After each guess the program prints out a text: Too high, Too low or Correct. Notice that the computer must not change the number between guesses.
import random

# Generate a random number between 1 and 10
target_number = random.randint(1, 10)

# Initialize a variable to keep track of the number of guesses
attempts = 0

while True:
    # Ask the user to guess the number

        print("Too high.")
    else:
        print(f"Correct! You guessed the number in {attempts} attempts.")
        break
# 5. Write a program that asks the user for a username and password. If either or both are incorrect, the program ask the user to enter the username and password again. This continues until the login information is correct or wrong credentials have been entered five times. If the information is correct, the program prints out Welcome. After five failed attempts the program prints out Access denied. The correct username is python and password rules.
# Define the correct username and password
correct_username = "python"
correct_password = "rules"

# Initialize the number of login attempts
attempts = 0

# Use a while loop to allow multiple login attempts
while attempts < 5:
    username = input("Enter your username: ")

    print("Access denied. You've reached the maximum number of login attempts.")
#6. Implement an algorithm for calculating an approximation for the value of pi (Ï). Let's assume that A is a unit circle. A unit circle has the radius of one and it is centered at the origin (0,0). Smallest possible square B is drawn around the unit circle so that circle A is completely inside the square. The corners of the square are now (-1,-1), (1, -1), (1, 1), and (-1, 1). If a large number of random points are scattered inside the square, the fraction of points that fall inside the circle A correlates with the fraction of the area of circle A compared to the area of square B: Ïr^2/4 = Ï*1^2/4 = Ï/4. This can be used as a simple method for calculating an approximation of the value of pi: Let's generate a large number of random points, such as one million, inside square B. Let N be the total number of random points. Each point inside the square is tested for whether it resides inside circle A. Let n be the total number of points that fall inside circle A. Now we have n/NâÏ/4, and from that we get Ïâ4n/N. Write a program that asks the user how many random points to generate, and then calculates the approximate value of pi using the method explained above. At the end, the program prints out the approximation of pi to the user. (Notice that it is easy to test if a point falls inside circle A by testing if it fulfills the inequation x^2+y^2<1.).
import random

# Ask the user for the number of random points to generate
num_points = int(input("Enter the number of random points to generate: "))

# Initialize the count of points inside the circle
points_inside_circle = 0

# Generate random points and check if they are inside the circle
for _ in range(num_points):
    x = random.uniform(-1, 1)  # Random x-coordinate between -1 and 1
    y = random.uniform(-1, 1)  # Random y-coordinate between -1 and 1
    if x**2 + y**2 < 1:  # Check if the point is inside the circle
        points_inside_circle += 1

# Calculate the approximate value of pi
approx_pi = 4 * points_inside_circle / num_points

# Print the approximation of pi
print(f"Approximation of pi: {approx_pi}")
# Module - 5
#1. Write a program that asks the user how many dice to roll. The program rolls all the dice once and prints out the sum of the numbers. Use a for loop.
import random

# Ask the user how many dice to roll
num_dice = int(input("Enter the number of dice to roll: "))

# Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum
total_sum = 0

# Roll the dice and calculate the sum
for _ in range(num_dice):
    roll = random.randint(1, 6)  # Simulate rolling a 6-sided die
    total_sum += roll

# Print the sum of the dice rolls
print(f"Sum of {num_dice} dice rolls: {total_sum}")
#2. Write a program that asks the user to enter numbers until they input an empty string to quit. At the end, the program prints out the five greatest numbers sorted in descending order. Hint: You can reverse the order of sorted list items by using the sort method with the reverse=True argument.
# Initialize an empty list to store numbers
numbers = []

# Input numbers from the user until an empty string is entered
while True:
    user_input = input("Enter a number (or press Enter to quit): ")

    if user_input == "":
        break

    try:
        number = float(user_input)
        numbers.append(number)
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter a number or press Enter to quit.")

# Check if there are any numbers to sort
if numbers:
    # Sort the list of numbers in descending order
    numbers.sort(reverse=True)

    # Print the top five numbers in descending order or all of them if there are less than five
    print("The five greatest numbers in descending order:")
    for num in numbers[:5]:
        print(num)
else:
    print("No valid numbers entered.")
#3. Write a program that asks the user for an integer and tells if the number is a prime number. Prime numbers are number that are only divisible by one or the number itself.

#For example, 13 is a prime number as it can only be divided by 1 or 13 so that the result is an integer.
#On the other hand, 21 is not a prime number as it is divisible by 3 and 7.
# Ask the user for an integer
num = int(input("Enter an integer: "))

# Check if the number is a prime number
if num < 2:
    is_prime = False
else:
    is_prime = True
    for i in range(2, int(num**0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            is_prime = False
            break

# Print the result
if is_prime:
    print(f"{num} is a prime number.")
else:
    print(f"{num} is not a prime number.")
#4. Write a program that asks the user to enter the names of five cities one by on (use a for loop for reading the names) and stores them into a list structure. Finally, the program prints out the names of the cities one by one, one city per line, in the same order they were read as input. Use a for loop for asking the names and a for/in loop to iterate through the list.
# Initialize an empty list to store city names
cities = []

# Use a for loop to read the names of five cities
for i in range(5):
    city_name = input(f"Enter the name of city {i + 1}: ")
    cities.append(city_name)

# Use a for/in loop to print the city names
print("Cities you entered:")
for city in cities:
    print(city)
# Module - 6
#1.Write a function that returns a random dice roll between 1 and 6. The function should not have any parameters. Write a main program that rolls the dice until the result is 6. The main program should print out the result of each roll.

    rolls += 1

    if result == 6:
        break

print(f"Congratulations! It took {rolls} rolls to get a 6.")
#2. Modify the function above so that it gets the number of sides on the dice as a parameter. With the modified function you can for example roll a 21-sided role-playing dice. The difference to the last exercise is that the dice rolling in the main program continues until the program gets the maximum number on the dice, which is asked from the user at the beginning.
import random

# Define a function to simulate a dice roll with a specified number of sides
def roll_dice(sides):
    return random.randint(1, sides)

# Ask the user for the number of sides and the maximum number on the dice
num_sides = int(input("Enter the number of sides on the dice: "))
max_number = int(input("Enter the maximum number on the dice: "))

# Main program to roll the dice until the maximum number is reached
rolls = 0
while True:
    result = roll_dice(num_sides)
    print(f"Roll {rolls + 1}: {result}")
    rolls += 1

        break

print(f"Congratulations! It took {rolls} rolls to get a {max_number}.")
#3.Write a function that gets the quantity of gasoline in American gallons and returns the number converted to litres. Write a main program that asks for a volume in gallons from the user and converts the value to liters. The conversion must be done by using the function. Conversions continue until the user inputs a negative value.

    print(f"{gallons} gallons is equal to {liters:.2f} liters")
#4. Write a function that gets a list of integers as a parameter. The function returns the sum of all the numbers in the list. For testing, write a main program where you create a list, call the function, and print out the value it returned.
# Define a function to calculate the sum of integers in a list
def sum_of_list(numbers):
    return sum(numbers)

# Main program for testing
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Create a list of integers
    integer_list = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]

    # Call the function and print the result
    result = sum_of_list(integer_list)
    print(f"The sum of the list is: {result}")
#5. Write a function that gets a list of integers as a parameter. The function returns a second list that is otherwise the same as the original list except that all uneven numbers have been removed. For testing, write a main program where you create a list, call the function, and then print out both the original as well as the cut-down list.
# Define a function to filter out odd numbers from a list
def remove_odd_numbers(numbers):
    even_numbers = [x for x in numbers if x % 2 == 0]
    return even_numbers

# Main program for testing
if __name__ == "__main":

    cut_down_list = remove_odd_numbers(integer_list)

    # Print the original and cut-down lists
    print("Original list:", integer_list)
    print("Cut-down list (even numbers only):", cut_down_list)
# 6. Write a function that receives two parameters: the diameter of a round pizza in centimeters and the price of the pizza in euros. The function calculates and returns the unit price of the pizza per square meter. The main program asks the user to enter the diameter and price of two pizzas and tells the user which pizza provides better value for money (which of them has a lower unit price). You must use the function you wrote for calculating the unit prices.
import math

# Define a function to calculate the unit price per square meter
def unit_price(diameter, price):
    radius = diameter / 2
    area = math.pi * (radius ** 2)
    unit_price = price / area

#2. Write a program that asks the user to enter names until he/she enters an empty string. After each name is read the program either prints out New name or Existing name depending on whether the name was entered for the first time. Finally, the program lists out the input names one by one, one below another in any order. Use the set data structure to store the names.

#3. Write a program for fetching and storing airport data. The program asks the user if they want to enter a new airport, fetch the information of an existing airport or quit. If the user chooses to enter a new airport, the program asks the user to enter the ICAO code and name of the airport. If the user chooses to fetch airport information instead, the program asks for the ICAO code of the airport and prints out the corresponding name. If the user chooses to quit, the program execution ends. The user can choose a new option as many times they want until they choose to quit. (The ICAO code is an identifier that is unique to each airport. For example, the ICAO code of Helsinki-Vantaa Airport is EFHK. You can easily find the ICAO codes of different airports online.)

#3 Write a program that asks the user to enter the ICAO codes of two airports. The program prints out the distance between the two airports in kilometers. The calculation is based on the airport coordinates fetched from the database. Calculate the distance using the geopy library: https://geopy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/. Install the library by selecting View / Tool Windows / Python Packages in your PyCharm IDE, write geopy into the search field and finish the installation.
